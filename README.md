# SharpParser :: A text input library built for C#

SharpParser is a C# package which intends to make user input simple. Whether it be for data input or for simple programming languages,
SharpParser makes it easy. All functionality can be used by creating a class which derives from a type with no abstract members, and using some simple attributes.

This library is compatable with C# 7.3, and should use no features which are of a later version unless wrapped in preprocessor directives.

This library will be expanded over time. Feel free to use!
